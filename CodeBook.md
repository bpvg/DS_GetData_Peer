## Variables

### ID

**subject**  
An integer from 1 to 30 identifying each of the subjects in the experiment

**activity**  
An identifier for each of the six activities preformed by each of the subjects. If you use the .RData file this variable is represented as a factor.   
The allowed values are the following:

1. WALKING  
2. WALKING_UPSTAIRS  
3. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS  
4. SITTING  
5. STANDING  
6. LAYING

## Welcome  

Hi,  
Welcome to my Course Project / Peer Assessment Assignment.  
The purpose of this work is to get and tidy a data set up.

The code for this assignment creates 8 different functions, each responsible for very specialized processing. A ninth function is also available to run each function in proper order.

   
-------------------
## Data Sources
For this assignment we're using data from the ["Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set"](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) as quoted under References.


-------------------
## Functions

### RunAll()
This is the main function and its purpose is to run all the other functions in proper order.  
  
**Arguments:**  
None

**Returns:**  
TRUE, if completed successfully.

### DataChecker()


### Merger()
